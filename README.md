# EcoLens: A Visionary Solution for a Plastic-Free World
## Project Idea
### Overview:
EcoLens is an innovative project at the intersection of technology and environmental
sustainability. It harnesses AI technology to address the global challenge of plastic waste and
pollution. By developing cutting-edge solution, EcoLens aims to detect, monitor, and mitigate
plastic waste, creating a cleaner and more sustainable world.
### Problem Statement:
Plastic waste significantly threatens ecosystems, biodiversity, and human health
worldwide. Current methods for detecting and managing plastic waste are often inefficient,
costly, and labor-intensive. The project aims to detect, monitor, and mitigate plastic waste to
create a cleaner and more sustainable world. By developing cutting-edge solution, EcoLens
seeks to:
1. Detect plastic waste in various environments.
2. Mitigate the impact of plastic waste through targeted interventions and waste
management strategies.
3. Map integration to monitor the movement and accumulation of plastic waste over time.
